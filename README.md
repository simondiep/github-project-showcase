# github-project-showcase

work-in-progress

The goal of this project is to allow anyone to easily showcase their github projects on a github pages site.

# To deploy to Github pages

`npm run deploy`

This leverages the npm module `gh-pages` to deploy to your repo, but under the gh-pages branch.

# How to display preview images

For each of your repositories:

- add an image called `preview.gif` at the top-most level
- add a Github Topic called `preview`

# Todo

- fetch from Github API
- write instructions to use
